While building apk I was getting a lot of errors in main.dart file just because I wrote WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() below the await Firebase intializeApp() . So , this small things can also affect your app drastically.

New Concepts I learnt from this clone :
1. SafeArea() : it is used just to avoid anything going out of screen because of change of the device . So this is used to keep some spacing on the screen which is called as SafeArea.

2. SvgPicture : 

3. Flexible Widget : Flexible widget is used when we want our some container to change it's positions as soon as some new widget is added on the same screen.
Here we used it for instagram so when we add any another widget now Instagram will automatically shift upwards.
it has parameter flex which takes value to adjust the position.

4. dispose : Dispose is used to remove the controller just after completing the current textField e.g. the _emailController will get disposed as soon as we complete that field.

5. pushReplacement : it is used when we want to replace our screen with other screen and not to push our pointer on some other screen . So , there's no any back option when you use pushReplacement for particular screen.

6. toJson : 

7. Document Snapshot :
